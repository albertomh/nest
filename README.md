### Prerequisites

To develop `nest` the following must be available locally:

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Quickstart: run locally

A `justfile` defines common development tasks. Run `just` to show all available recipes.

```sh
# run a hot-reloading local server on :8080
just serve

# build the site and place static assets
# in the `dist/` directory
just build
```

### Development workflow

This repo follows trunk-based development. This means:

- the `main` branch should always be in a releasable state
- use short-lived feature branches

Pre-commit hooks are available to prevent common gotchas and to lint & format code.

```sh
# install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
guidelines when writing commit messages.
`commitlint` is enabled as a pre-commit hook. Valid commit types are defined in `.commitlintrc.yaml`.

## Project structure

TODO: document

## Frontend styles

The frontend is styled using Bootstrap 5. Specifically, a project-specific version
customised to use the DepositDuck palette which lives at [albertomh/speculum](https://github.com/albertomh/speculum).

Static assets (Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons) - all from the `speculum` package - are hosted
in a public Cloudflare R2 bucket with CORS enabled to allow GET from `localhost:8000`.
